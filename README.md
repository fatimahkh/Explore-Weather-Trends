# Explore-Weather-Trends
The First project 

## Overview 
I use the SQL to extract data from the temperatures database, then download the results to a CSV. Then I open it up in a spreadsheet program in order to analyze it.

## Research Questions
Q1:Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average?

Q2:How do the changes in your cityâ€™s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?

Q3:What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?

## Tools
Python, Pandas, excel and Jupyter Notebook

## Results
-My City is hotter than the global average, and yes is consistent over time.

-In my city the temperatures frequently fixed with the same range, where the global temperatures are increased over time.

-Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
Overall trend looks like the world getting hotter, and the trend has been consistent.
